### Translations

Translations of the natural language strings are managed through a third party translation interface, transifex.com. Newly added strings will be periodically uploaded there for translation, and any new translations will be merged back to the project source code.

Please use [https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/silverstripe-cwp-core](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/silverstripe-cwp-core) to contribute translations, rather than sending pull requests with YAML files.
